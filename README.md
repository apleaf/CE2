#ANALYSIS

My test bench shows an output of 0001 for an input of 111, which matches
the picture from the CE2 directions.  My testbench shows an output of 
0010 for an input of 011, which matches the input and outputs from the 
picture in the CE2 directions.  Following this method, all my inputs and 
outputs match up with the picture in the CE2 directions.

Question 15.  A decoder is a group of logic gates arranged in a way to decode a combination of inputs to a set of terms that are all set to 0 apart from one term. When one input changes, that causes two output terms to change as well.
